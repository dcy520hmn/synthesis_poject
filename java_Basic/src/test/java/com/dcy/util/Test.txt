Unbounded, unordered, global-scale datasets are increasingly common in day-to-day business (e.g. Web logs, mobile
usage statistics, and sensor networks). At the same time,
consumers of these datasets have evolved sophisticated requirements, such as event-time ordering and windowing by
features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable
hunger for faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates
that one can never fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost for these types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are left with the quandary
of how to reconcile the tensions between these seemingly
competing propositions, often resulting in disparate implementations and systems.
